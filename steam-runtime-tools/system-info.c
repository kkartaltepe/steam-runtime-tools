 * @include: steam-runtime-tools/steam-runtime-tools.h
 *
 * #SrtSystemInfo is an opaque object representing information about
 * the system. Information is retrieved "lazily"; when it has been
 * retrieved, it is cached until the #SrtSystemInfo is destroyed.
 *
 * This is a reference-counted object: use g_object_ref() and
 * g_object_unref() to manage its lifecycle.
 *
 * The #SrtSystemInfo object is not thread-aware. It should be considered
 * to be "owned" by the thread that created it. Only the thread that
 * "owns" the #SrtSystemInfo may call its methods.
 * Other threads may create their own parallel #SrtSystemInfo object and
 * use that instead, if desired.
 *
 * Ownership can be transferred to other threads by an operation that
 * implies a memory barrier, such as g_atomic_pointer_set() or
 * g_object_ref(), but after this is done the previous owner must not
 * continue to call methods.
