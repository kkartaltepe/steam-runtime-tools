/**
 * SrtRuntimeIssues:
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_NONE: There are no problems
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_UNKNOWN: A generic internal error occurred while
 *  trying to detect the status of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`-based Steam Runtime,
 *  or, while reading a report, either an unknown issue flag was encountered
 *  or the runtime issues field was missing
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_DISABLED: The Steam Runtime has been disabled
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_NOT_RUNTIME: The Steam Runtime does not appear to
 *  have the correct structure
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_UNOFFICIAL: The Steam Runtime is an unofficial build
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_UNEXPECTED_LOCATION: The Steam Runtime is not in
 *  the location that was expected
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_UNEXPECTED_VERSION: The Steam Runtime is not the
 *  version that was expected
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_NOT_IN_LD_PATH: The Steam Runtime is not in the
 *  expected position in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_NOT_IN_PATH: The Steam Runtime is not in the
 *  expected position in the `PATH`
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_NOT_IN_ENVIRONMENT: The environment variable
 *  `STEAM_RUNTIME` is not set to the absolute path to the Steam Runtime
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_NOT_USING_NEWER_HOST_LIBRARIES: The Steam Runtime has
 *  been configured to not use host libraries even if they are newer than
 *  the libraries in the Steam Runtime. This is likely to work
 *  acceptably with NVIDIA non-free graphics drivers, but is likely to
 *  break Mesa.
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_ON_NON_UNIX_FILESYSTEM: The Steam Runtime is
 *  stored on a non-Unix filesystem which might not preserve permissions,
 *  ownership and other metadata.
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_ON_NETWORK_FILESYSTEM: The Steam Runtime is
 *  stored on a networked filesystem, which might make metadata operations
 *  unexpectedly slow.
 * @SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_ON_UNKNOWN_FILESYSTEM: The Steam Runtime is
 *  stored on a filesystem not known to the diagnostic tool, or a virtual
 *  filesystem such as FUSE or overlayfs which could be backed by an unknown
 *  underlying filesystem.
 *
 * A bitfield with flags representing problems with the Steam Runtime, or
 * %SRT_RUNTIME_ISSUES_NONE (which is numerically zero) if no problems
 * were detected.
 *
 * In general, more bits set means more problems.
