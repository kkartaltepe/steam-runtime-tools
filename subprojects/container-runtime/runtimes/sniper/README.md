Development and debugging
-------------------------

The runtime's behaviour can be changed by running the Steam client with
environment variables set.

`STEAM_LINUX_RUNTIME_LOG=1` will enable logging. Log files appear in
`SteamLinuxRuntime/var/slr-*.log`, with filenames containing the app ID.
`slr-latest.log` is a symbolic link to whichever one was created most
recently.

`STEAM_LINUX_RUNTIME_VERBOSE=1` produces more detailed log output,
either to a log file (if `STEAM_LINUX_RUNTIME_LOG=1` is also used) or to
the same place as `steam` output (otherwise).

`PRESSURE_VESSEL_SHELL=instead` runs an interactive shell in the
container instead of running the game.

Please see
<https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/blob/main/docs/distro-assumptions.md>
for details of assumptions made about the host operating system, and some
advice on debugging the container runtime on new Linux distributions.
